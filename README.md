A code break should be able to identify:

* the height of an alien
* how long it lives
* how big its signal-transmitting device is
* how long it's been communicating across the galaxy
* what it lives on
* the age of its solar system

for now, i made PHP script that downloads message and creates GIF image

how to start PHP script:

**`php SETI_message.php`**

downloaded message will be in file **`SETI_message.txt`**

image will be created in file **`SETI_message.gif`**
